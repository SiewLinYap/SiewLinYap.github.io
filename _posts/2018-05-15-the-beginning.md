  Approaching the graduation of a data science immersive course, I've been forwarded and reading a few articles lately concerning the topics about the fear of data science and its analytical works to be taken over by powerful AI platforms. There were also a few articles circulating around describing data scientist could be potentially very soon no longer the demanding one in the job market. While it's probably good to stay alert and be aware of how the working eco-system has now changed, we probably shouldn't be too concerned that what we've learned through the entire course will be of somewhat wasted due to the fact that it can now easily be done through intelligent, user-friendly, automated powerful software. 

  Every academic subject or module has its uniqueness and various specialization levels. It requires different corresponding thought processes that fit into it for the understanding of the concept, knowledge acquisition and learning. What we learn in data science isn't just the theory or knowledge itself, but the computational thinking and the different ways of problem solving. The thought processes involve integration of various subject matters to find out the best possible solution in order to gain insights that are not so visible to others. The struggle and the accomplishment of the various small projects and particularly the final capstone project have even strengthened my belief that this has helped me to grow and think differently. Along this journey, I am also learning how to communicate complex issues in a simpler approach, so it can be understood and fan out to targetted audience effectively. I benefit a lot throughout the entire course. I strongly believe this skillset and the multidisciplinary problem solving and thinking skills have way more values than people who know how to press few clicks mechanically on the intelligent software to easily get the answer out.

  Hopefully this helps to convey a positive message to my coursemates, any other aspiring data science graduates and people who are still doubtful about the prospect of data analytics. Let's continue learning even the course has ended. Stay positive by embracing what new powerful softwares can bring and engaging ourselves deeply to gain the most out of it.
